            <h4>Sunday 10th August 2014</h4>
              Cancer UK Run – Gloucester, a charity event arranged by Chris in Gloucester asked JellyBean Photography to photograph the Cancer UK 5K Run in Gloucester and although the weather was against all of us the day was a very memorable day, the heavy rain and wind didn’t dampen the fun of the event or the enthusiasm of all the participants.

            <h4>April 2014</h4>
              G.O.S.H Events (Great Ormond Street Hospital) had arranged a number of fund raising events for help raise some money for a very worthy cause. JellyBean Photography had the privilege of photographing the Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity Bonnie Baby Competition, the day took a while to get running but the excitement from all the parents with their gorgeous babies posing and sleeping I must admit for snap after snap of photographs.
              The day was very eventful and was a great day and it was all for a good cause, there was a surprise visit from Cheltenham’s local fire brigade which the children loved as they got to see and sit inside the fire engine.

The day started off with the wedding Reception at the Cheltenham Registry Office shortly after midday, the sun beaming out and a very smart looking Groom and a very beautiful Bride.
              A lovely warming reception and some very happy smiling people as the married couple left the reception and headed to the group shots. The group shots was set in Wellington Square a lovely garden with a lovely backdrop scenery.
              This lead on to the wedding party held at ‘The Midland’ pub in Cheltenham a lovely Function room decorated in purple and white, the thing that stood out the most had to be the Bride designed wedding cake, a real eye for detail in a lovely stylise cake.

          <h3>Serena and Zoe's Studio Shoot...</h3>
            <h4>Sunday 16th November 2014</h4>
              Serena and Zoe’s Studio Shoot was created as two separate brides wanted to try their wedding dresses on again and JellyBean Photography was looking for their first studio shoot. Two beautiful brides from Cheltenham came forward to help out, the day started off preparing the shoot and the background and lighting which with a few hours of tinkering and learning was a real eye opener. We had opted for a white background with a 3 light set-up.
              Once Serena and Zoe had arrived at the studio they got into their wedding dresses then the shoot began, starting out with some traditional poses with no props and slowly working our way into more modern and stylish and fashion inspired poses.
              Both Serena and Zoe was amazing models to work with, this really helped counting it was my first official shoot in a studio and JellyBean Photography couldn’t have thanked them both enough for all their help.

            <h4>Thursday 10th December 2015</h4>
              A Portrait Shoot is always a great way to try new equipment or techniques. JellyBean Photography decided to do a session on Thursday 10th December 2015 using our new lights, we decided on a single light set-up with a soft box attached and a white reflector.
              The session went really well and was a bundle of fun, a great laugh and after a couple of hours, and about 170 photos later we decided that it was a success and time to call it a night.
              A huge thank you to my model for the night, my gorgeous wife Ami Taylor, who looked stunning and although not a person who likes seeing images of herself seemed to really be getting into it. We have some great images and a lot of laughs throughout the night.
              We also had time to do some self-portraits of myself which will be appearing on the website shortly.
              JellyBean Photography offers a variety of studio shoots weather its for a portfolio to start into modelling or it be for images for a gift for a loved one. We can offer shoots in our studio or if the client prefers we can come to you with our portable studio set-up and you can have the shoot in the comfort of your own home.
              We can also offer outdoor shoots if you are looking for new ideas for change of scenery for your images weather that’s for an image to hang on your wall in the house or for the profile picture on your Facebook or Twitter page.
