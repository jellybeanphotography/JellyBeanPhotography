        <h2>Get to know JellyBean Photography and Scott Taylor.</h2>
          <h3>About Me...</h3>
          <h4>Hi, my name is Scott Taylor a Gloucestershire Freelance Photographer offering photography services throughout Gloucestershire. I have been photographing as a hobby since 2011 and professionally since mid 2014.
          The areas of photography I cover are wedding, portraiture, band, Child/Baby photography as well as Motorsport photography.
          I live and work in Cheltenham and know the Gloucestershire area very well, along with many of the local wedding venues.
          I have a passion in photography and believe in getting the very best moments photographed in the best possible way for you to recall on for many years to come.
          I have an easy approach to life which includes Reading, Walking and Photography.
          I have worked with a couple of Cheltenham based bands that perform at weddings and also photographed for those bands at weddings and corporate events, which offers me a unique position of knowing the runnings for a wedding from multiple aspects.
          I have a beautiful family, Ami my wife and our gorgeous daughter Ellie. We got married on the 1st August 2013 in Cheltenham and we currently live in Cheltenham raising our gorgeous daughter.
          JellyBean Photography got its name from my Daughter Ellie, since she was born we nicknamed her Ellie-Jelly-Bean and as time went on it became Jelly-Moo so it was only right to name the photography business as my gorgeous daughterâ€™s nickname and JellyBean Photography was born.</p>

          <h2>What do our clients have to say about us...</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <h3>Tommy Lewis - Tommy and the Fuse</h3>
              <h4>Scott has photographed a number of events for the band, starting with an evening in the summer at All Bar One, Cheltenham. We were instantly impressed by Scott's ability to understand our requirements, and how quickly he was able to put forward great ideas to suit the location and tone.
              Scott was fantastic at using the space around him considering the busyness of the venue, and was able to get some impressive shots.
              He has such a friendly and open approach, we will definitely be using his services again!</h4>

                <h3>Sandy Turner</h3>
                <h4>Had some lovely photos taken by Scott, very pleased with the whole experience.
                Many thanks,
                Highly recommend.</h4>

                <blockquote>
                  <h3>Niki Banks - NKB Training</h3>
                  <h4>Having a wish to add some new photographs to my training website, I approached Scott from JellyBean Photography. I met him a couple of times to discuss any ideas I had, and to chat through what I was looking for and hoping to achieve and an appointment was booked. The day of the shoot was fun. We had several pieces of fitness equipment in the shots, with my main focus being on my intrinsic biomechanics work, kettlebells and my love of yoga.
                  Scott was very patient and took his time in working out the best angles to get the photographs I wanted. Overall I am very pleased with the results, I have both colour and black and white versions of all the shots and I am now choosing the ones which will go on the website.
                  I would highly recommend JellyBean Photography. Scott definitely provides a more personal touch, nothing is too much trouble and no idea too silly (even photos with skeletons!).</h4>

                      The weather was less than desirable but Scott used this to his advantage and got some really good artistic shots.
