          <p>Hi, my name is Scott Taylor a Gloucestershire Freelance Photographer offering photography services throughout Gloucestershire. I have been photographing as a hobby since 2011 and professionally since mid 2014.</p>
          <p>The areas of photography I cover are wedding, portraiture, band, Child/Baby photography as well as Motorsport photography.
          I live and work in Cheltenham and know the Gloucestershire area very well, along with many of the local wedding venues.
          I have a passion in photography and believe in getting the very best moments photographed in the best possible way for you to recall on for many years to come.
          I have an easy approach to life which includes Reading, Walking and Photography.
          I have worked with a couple of Cheltenham based bands that perform at weddings and also photographed for those bands at weddings and corporate events, which offers me a unique position of knowing the runnings for a wedding from multiple aspects.
          I have a beautiful family, Ami my wife and our gorgeous daughter Ellie. We got married on the 1st August 2013 in Cheltenham and we currently live in Cheltenham raising our gorgeous daughter.
          JellyBean Photography got its name from my Daughter Ellie, since she was born we nicknamed her Ellie-Jelly-Bean and as time went on it became Jelly-Moo so it was only right to name the photography business as my gorgeous daughterâ€™s nickname and JellyBean Photography was born.</p>
          <p>JellyBean Photography is a Freelance Photography service based in Cheltenham, we offer tailored packages for all budgets for all areas of photography.
          JellyBean Photography can offer brides and grooms packages to ensure their day is captured for years of happy memories to come.
          All of our wedding packages these can be tailored to suit your needs, from covering just the wedding ceremony all the way to covering the Bride and Groom getting ready to come to the ceremony and through to the first dance and cake cut.
          From the first meeting to the day you get married JellyBean Photography can offer help and support for all the little worries of types of photographs and arranging all the family for the group shots. JellyBean Photography was formed in 2015 by Scott Taylor to offer tailored wedding and photography packages to brides, grooms and clients for all areas of photography.
          Scott has 4 years photography knowledge with qualifications within Photography, Scott has first hand experience of photographing weddings, events and corporate events along with portraiture studio work.
          I have been photographing weddings both as a first and second shooter photographer giving both views of a wedding day to be able to capture all those special moments that the happy couple may not see on their special day.</p>
